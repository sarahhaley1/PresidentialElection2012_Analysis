### Background
The US presidential election in 2012 resulted in an unsurprising out come, meaning it went as predicted. However, the 2016 election took the nation by surprise. The results of the election showed that predicting voter behavior is complicated no matter the efforts put into collecting, analyzing, and understanding numerous available data sets.

### Purpose 
The purpose of this analysis was to merge the census data with voting data in 2016 to analyze the election's outcome. Using three datasets: tract-level 2010 census data, metadata, and county-level vote tallies from the 2016 election our goal was to clean the data sets and then perform further analysis and find the correct model that represents the outcome of the election optimally.
